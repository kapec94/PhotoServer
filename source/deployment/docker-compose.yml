# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Windows / AMD64)
#
# Note:
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), especially when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - Windows Pro users should disable the WSL 2 based engine in Docker Settings > General so that
#   they can mount drives other than C:. This will enable Hyper-V, which Microsoft doesn't offer
#   to its Windows Home customers. Docker Desktop uses dynamic memory allocation with WSL 2.
#   It's important to explicitly increase the Docker memory limit to 4 GB or more when using Hyper-V.
#   The default of 2 GB may reduce indexing performance and cause unexpected restarts.
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik, Caddy, or NGINX. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments.
